Anchovy

Anchovy is (or will be) a Perl WebMail App.  As a CGI::Application
user, it will run happily under mod_perl, FastCGI and as a plain old
CGI script.  It will by default use IMAP[S] for authentication as well
as mail access, though it should be possible to create plugins for 
authentication or to allow other mail access methods (for example, 
reading from the file system where it runs on the mail spool server).

For right now, installing and using this module will do exactly
nothing.  Code and content will be forthcoming in the days and weeks
to follow.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
